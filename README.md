# soflash

The purpose of this website is to allow users to upload, test themselves on and share flashcards with each other.

It is also a showcase project for a typical opensource, fullstack MERN project featuring:

- users capable of logging in via Google (e.g. with Kinde)
- backend deployeed at Hetzner
- frontend deployed at Vercel
- cloud database at MongoDB Atlas
- devop workflows (dev/main branches, release versions, GitHub Actions)

## status

- this project is currently in early [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) stage (Nov 2024)
- I use it on my computer and phone to learn from Spanish flashcards I create
- for other users besides me, there is not yet an option to add flashcards, just test yourself with them
- nor can you log in yet, but the guest user can take flashcards and earn points as if they are logged in
